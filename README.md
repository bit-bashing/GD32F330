# GD32F330
GigaDevice Cortex M4 MCU

I bought some GigaDevice GD32F330F8P6 20-pin TSSOP parts from LCSC.com which cost $1.05 each.

Supposedly, they have 8 Kbyte SRAM and 64 Kbyte flash memory.
They run at 84 MHz @ 3V3 and have a Cortex-M4 core.
These might be the cheapest Cortex-M4 MCUs available at present (December 2018).

I soldered one of the parts onto a TSSOP to DIL breakout board (photo below)

I started off trying to program them with the free/evaluation Keil MDK v.5.26 toolchain along with a J-Link Mini Edu SWD/JTAG
